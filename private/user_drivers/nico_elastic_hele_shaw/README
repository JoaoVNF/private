Nico's postdoc stuff. The scripts do the following

what it says...

-rw-r--r-- 1 mheil users 259 Oct 25 08:27 run_steady.bash

Moving frame formulation.
Starts from rigid Hele Shaw and then does some continuation (specified
in driver code). Flag --inc_thin_films includes presence of thin films
whose parameters are based on the tip capillary number. See write-up.

-rw-r--r-- 1 mheil users 370 Oct 25 08:27 run_steady_restart.bash

Restarts runs from above. Need to specify the flux ahead of the bubble
that was imposed when the restart file was generated (it's in the trace file).

-rw-r--r-- 1 mheil users 270 Oct 25 08:27 run_steady_symmetric.bash
-rw-r--r-- 1 mheil users 381 Oct 25 08:27 run_steady_symmetric_restart.bash

Ditto but for symmetric code.

-rwxr-xr-x 1 mheil users 310 Oct 25 08:27 run_unsteady.bash

Unsteady, direct simulation in the lab frame and the capillary number
for the thin film corrections (if used) is based on the imposed
flow rate.
